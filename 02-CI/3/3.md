## Topic 3: Configuring GitHub Repositories for CI/CD

### Creating Repositories for Java (Backend) and Node.js (Frontend) on GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub Account**:
   - If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, create one at https://github.com/join.
2. **Create a Java Repository (Backend)**:
   - Go to GitHub > New Repository > Name the repository (e.g., "java-backend").
   - Choose visibility (public or private).
   - Click “Create repository”.
3. **Create a Node.js Repository (Frontend)**:
   - Follow the same steps as above but create a repository for your Node.js frontend (e.g., "node-frontend").

### Setting Up Webhooks to Trigger Jenkins Jobs on Push

1. **Access GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Open the repository (Java or Node.js) on GitHub.
   - Go to “Settings” > “Webhooks” > “Add webhook”.
2. **Set the Payload URL**:
   - In the Payload URL field, add the URL of your Jenkins instance, followed by `/github-webhook/`.
   - Example: `http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/`
3. **Select Content Type**:
   - Set the Content type to `application/json`.
4. **Choose Events to Trigger the Webhook**:
   - Select “Just the push event” to trigger Jenkins jobs when there’s a push to the repository.
5. **Save the Webhook**:
   - After filling out the webhook configuration, click “Add webhook” to save it.
   - This ensures that Jenkins will be triggered every time code is pushed to the GitHub repository.

### Managing Credentials in GitHub for Secure Access (e.g., SSH Keys, Tokens)

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens.
   - Click on “Generate new token”.
   - Choose the appropriate scopes (e.g., `repo`, `workflow` for CI/CD).
   - Generate the token and save it securely.
2. **Add GitHub Credentials in Jenkins**:
   - In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials > (Global).
   - Add a new credential, choosing the “GitHub Personal Access Token” option.
   - Enter the GitHub token generated earlier.
3. **Use SSH Keys for Authentication**:
   - If you prefer SSH over HTTPS, generate an SSH key pair.
   - Add the public key to your GitHub account under Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
   - In Jenkins, configure your job to use the SSH key for authentication with GitHub.

### Organizing Branches and Triggers in GitHub to Support CI/CD Workflows

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Decide on a branching strategy that fits your workflow. Common strategies include:
     - **Git Flow**: Use `develop` for ongoing work and `main` (or `master`) for production-ready code.
     - **GitHub Flow**: Use `main` for the latest production code and create feature branches for new work.
2. **Configure Jenkins to Trigger Jobs Based on Branches**:
   - In Jenkins, you can set up different jobs to run for specific branches.
   - For example, trigger the build on the `develop` branch for the backend Java job and the `main` branch for the frontend Node.js job.
3. **Use Pull Requests to Trigger Jenkins Jobs**:
   - Configure Jenkins to trigger jobs on pull request events to test code before merging into the main branch.
   - This can be set up in Jenkins by using the GitHub PR trigger plugin.

By the end of this topic, learners should be able to:
- Create and manage GitHub repositories for backend (Java) and frontend (Node.js) projects.
- Set up webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs upon code pushes.
- Manage credentials securely in GitHub and Jenkins.
- Organize branches and set up appropriate triggers in GitHub to streamline CI/CD workflows.
