### Topic 6: Automating Docker Hub Integration and Deployment

#### Automating Docker Hub login and image push through Jenkins pipeline
- In Jenkins, automate Docker Hub login by using securely stored credentials.
- Use Jenkins credentials manager to store your Docker Hub username and password/token.
- In the pipeline, use `docker login` with these credentials before executing push commands.

#### Configuring Docker Hub repositories for public/private access
- Docker Hub repositories can be configured as public or private.
- Public repositories allow anyone to pull the image, while private repositories require authentication.
- This configuration can be set when creating a repository or updated in the repository settings.

#### Pushing Docker images from Jenkins to Docker Hub
- In the Jenkins pipeline, build Docker images using `docker build`.
- Use `docker tag` to apply a meaningful tag, such as version numbers or environment identifiers.
- Push the image to Docker Hub using `docker push`, ensuring the tag matches the repository structure.

#### Deploying Docker images to staging/production environments (using Jenkins and Docker)
- After the image is pushed to Docker Hub, Jenkins can deploy it to staging/production.
- Use `docker pull` on the target servers or orchestration tools like Kubernetes to fetch the image.
- Deploy using a pipeline script that automates the pull and run commands.
- 
#### Best practices for tagging and versioning Docker images
- Use semantic versioning for tagging Docker images, such as `v1.0.0` for releases.
- Always use `latest` cautiously, as it may cause ambiguity in deployments.
- Include environment-specific tags like `staging` or `prod` to differentiate deployments.
