# Topic 5: Creating Jenkins Pipelines for Java and Node.js

## Overview
In this topic, we'll set up Jenkins pipelines for both Java backend (Spring Boot) and Node.js frontend (React) applications. We'll use Jenkinsfiles to automate builds, tests, and deployments. Additionally, we'll use Docker for building and testing both Java and Node.js applications in Jenkins.

## Steps to Set Up Jenkins Pipelines

### 1. **Setting Up a Pipeline in Jenkins for Java Backend (Spring Boot) and Node.js Frontend (React)**

- **Java Backend (Spring Boot)**: We'll create a Jenkins pipeline for building, testing, and deploying a Java application using Maven.
- **Node.js Frontend (React)**: A similar Jenkins pipeline will be set up for building, testing, and deploying a Node.js application using NPM/Yarn.

Both pipelines will include stages for building, testing, and deploying.

### 2. **Using Jenkinsfile for Automated Builds, Tests, and Deployments**

Create a `Jenkinsfile` for both Java and Node.js projects. This file defines the pipeline's steps for automating the process.

### 3. **Implementing Stages for Build, Test, and Deploy**

In the Jenkinsfile, we define different stages for building, testing, and deploying both the backend and frontend applications.

### 4. **Using Docker for Building and Testing Java and Node.js Applications in Jenkins**

We will utilize Docker for creating isolated environments to build and test both the Java and Node.js applications in Jenkins. This ensures consistent environments across different stages.

### 5. **Example: Running Maven for Java and NPM/Yarn for Node.js in the Pipeline**
