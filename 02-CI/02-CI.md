## CI/CD Course for Backend (Java) and Frontend (Node.js) with Jenkins, Docker Hub, and GitHub

### Topic 1: Introduction to CI/CD and Tools Overview

- What is CI/CD?
- Benefits of CI/CD in modern development
- Overview of Jenkins, Docker, Docker Hub, and GitHub
- How these tools integrate into a CI/CD pipeline
- Setting up a simple CI/CD pipeline for both Java (backend) and Node.js (frontend)

### Topic 2: Setting Up Jenkins in Docker

- Installing Jenkins on Docker using a Docker container
- Accessing Jenkins UI through the browser
- Creating the first Jenkins job
- Integrating Jenkins with GitHub repositories for both backend (Java) and frontend (Node.js)
- Installing necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Git, Docker, Maven, NodeJS)

### Topic 3: Configuring GitHub Repositories for CI/CD

- Creating repositories for Java (backend) and Node.js (frontend) on GitHub
- Setting up webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs on push
- Managing credentials in GitHub for secure access (e.g., SSH keys, tokens)
- Organizing branches and triggers in GitHub to support CI/CD workflows

### Topic 4: Dockerizing Java and Node.js Applications

- Building Docker images for Java backend (e.g., using Maven)
- Writing a Dockerfile for Java backend and Node.js frontend applications
- Building Docker images and pushing to Docker Hub
- Best practices for Dockerizing Java and Node.js applications
- Using multi-stage Docker builds to optimize image size

### Topic 5: Creating Jenkins Pipelines for Java and Node.js

- Setting up a pipeline in Jenkins for Java backend and Node.js frontend
- Using Jenkinsfile for automated builds, tests, and deployments
- Implementing stages for build, test, and deploy
- Using Docker for building and testing Java and Node.js applications in Jenkins
- Example: Running Maven for Java and NPM/Yarn for Node.js in the pipeline

### Topic 6: Automating Docker Hub Integration and Deployment

- Automating Docker Hub login and image push through Jenkins pipeline
- Configuring Docker Hub repositories for public/private access
- Pushing Docker images from Jenkins to Docker Hub
- Deploying Docker images to staging/production environments (using Jenkins and Docker)
- Best practices for tagging and versioning Docker images
