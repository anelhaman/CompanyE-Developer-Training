## 1. Introduction to Docker

### What is Docker?
Docker is a platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Containers allow applications to run in isolated environments, which makes them portable and consistent across different computing environments.

### Docker vs Virtual Machines
- **Docker**: Containers share the host operating system's kernel, which makes them lightweight and fast. They start quickly and have a small footprint.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: VMs include the entire operating system, which means they are heavier, slower to start, and take up more resources than containers.

### Benefits of Docker
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of underlying hardware or operating system.
- **Efficiency**: Docker is more resource-efficient compared to virtual machines because containers share the host operating system's kernel.
- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that applications run the same way in different environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy.
