## 7. Docker Volumes

### What are Volumes?
Volumes are used to persist data created by and used by Docker containers. Unlike the container filesystem, which is ephemeral, volumes persist even after the container is removed.

### Managing Volumes
To create a volume, you can use the `docker volume create` command.
Example:
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```

To list all volumes:
```bash
docker volume ls
```

To inspect a volume:
```bash
docker volume inspect my-volume
```

To remove a volume:
```bash
docker volume rm my-volume
```

### Mounting Volumes
Volumes can be mounted into containers using the `-v` option when running a container.

Example:
```bash
docker run -d -v my-volume:/data nginx
```

This command mounts the `my-volume` volume to the `/data` directory inside the container.

### Using Volumes with Containers
Volumes are useful for storing persistent data, such as databases or application state. They can be shared between containers to enable data consistency.
For example, a database container and a backup container can share the same volume to store database files and backups.
