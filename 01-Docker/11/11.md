## 11. Docker and CI/CD

### Using Docker with Jenkins
Docker can be integrated with Jenkins to automate the build and deployment of Docker containers. You can use Docker in Jenkins pipelines to build, test, and deploy applications in containers.

Example Jenkins pipeline with Docker:
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build Docker Image') {
      steps {
        script {
          docker.build('my-image')
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy to Docker') {
      steps {
        script {
          docker.image('my-image').push()
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example shows a simple Jenkins pipeline that builds a Docker image and pushes it to a Docker registry.

### Building Docker Images in CI/CD Pipeline
Docker images can be built as part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the latest code is always packaged in a container. This is useful for maintaining consistent environments across different stages of the pipeline.

Example of building Docker images in a pipeline:
- In Jenkins, you can use `docker.build` to build an image with a specific tag.
- In GitLab CI, you can use Docker commands in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to build and push Docker images.

### Continuous Deployment with Docker
Docker enables Continuous Deployment (CD) by automating the deployment process with containers. Once an image is built, it can be deployed automatically to the production environment, ensuring that changes are quickly and safely rolled out.

Example of deploying a Docker container in a CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-image
```

This example shows a basic deployment step in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, where a Docker container is started from the built image.
