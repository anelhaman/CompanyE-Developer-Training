## 2. Docker Architecture

### Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the core component of Docker that is responsible for creating, managing, and running Docker containers. It consists of three parts: the Docker daemon, the Docker CLI, and the Docker REST API.

### Docker Images
Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. They contain the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files required for the application to run. Images can be pulled from public or private repositories.

### Docker Containers
Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, etc.). Containers run as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system.

### Docker Daemon
The Docker Daemon (`dockerd`) is a background service that manages Docker containers and images. It communicates with the Docker CLI to manage the lifecycle of containers, images, networks, and volumes.

### Docker CLI
The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is the user interface for interacting with Docker. It allows users to issue commands to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks. The CLI communicates with the Docker daemon via REST APIs.
