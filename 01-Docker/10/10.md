## 10. Docker Security

### Container Security Best Practices
Container security is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities. Some best practices include:

- Keep containers minimal by using official or well-maintained base images.
- Regularly update containers to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Limit container privileges by using the `--user` flag to run containers with specific user permissions.
- Use Docker's built-in security features like seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux to restrict container actions.

### Securing Docker Daemon
The Docker daemon is the core component that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes. Securing the Docker daemon is important to prevent unauthorized access to Docker resources.

- Use TLS to secure communication between the Docker client and the Docker daemon.
- Restrict access to the Docker daemon by using the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable and proper firewall rules.
- Use a non-root user to run the Docker daemon, instead of using the root user.

### User Namespaces
User namespaces allow the separation of the host and container user IDs, increasing security by mapping container users to different host users. This prevents a compromised container from accessing the host's resources.

To enable user namespaces, you need to configure Docker's `daemon.json` file:
```json
{
  "userns-remap": "default"
}
```

### Docker Content Trust
Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a security feature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of images being pulled or pushed. When DCT is enabled, Docker only allows images signed with a trusted key to be used.

To enable Docker Content Trust:
```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

This will ensure that only signed images can be pulled or pushed, preventing the use of tampered or insecure images.
