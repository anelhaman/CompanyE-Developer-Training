## 5. Docker Images

### Building Docker Images
To build a Docker image, you use the `docker build` command along with a `Dockerfile` that contains instructions for building the image.

Example:
```bash
docker build -t my-image:latest .
```

This command will build the image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory (`.`) and tag the image as `my-image:latest`.

### Dockerfile Basics
A `Dockerfile` is a script with a set of instructions to create a Docker image. It defines the environment, dependencies, and configurations required to run an application.

Basic Dockerfile Example:
```bashdockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Docker Hub and Registries
Docker Hub is the default public registry where you can find and share Docker images. You can also use private registries to store images securely.
To interact with Docker Hub, you use commands like `docker pull` and `docker push`.
Example:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

### Tagging Images
Docker images are tagged using the `docker tag` command, allowing you to version and manage your images.

Example:
```bash
docker tag my-image:latest my-repo/my-image:v1.0
```

This command tags the image `my-image:latest` with the version `v1.0` and associates it with a specific repository.

### Pushing and Pulling Images
You can upload (push) or download (pull) Docker images from Docker Hub or other registries.

- To push an image to a registry:
```
docker push my-repo/my-image:v1.0
```

- To pull an image from a registry:
```
docker pull my-repo/my-image:v1.0
```
