## 6. Docker Networking

### Network Types (Bridge, Host, Overlay)
Docker provides several networking modes for containers to communicate with each other and the outside world:

- **Bridge**: The default network mode for containers. Containers are connected to a virtual bridge and can communicate with each other.
- **Host**: The container shares the hostâ€™s network stack and can access local network resources directly.
- **Overlay**: Used for multi-host networking, typically in a Docker Swarm setup, where containers on different hosts can communicate as if they were on the same network.

### Exposing Ports
To allow external access to a container's services, you need to expose ports using the `-p` option.

Example:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This command maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container, allowing access to the Nginx web server.

### Docker Compose Networking
Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. By default, Compose creates a single network for all containers, allowing them to communicate with each other using their service names.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  app:
    image: my-app
    environment:
      - DATABASE_HOST=db
  db:
    image: postgres
```

In this example, `app` can connect to the `db` container using the service name `db`.
