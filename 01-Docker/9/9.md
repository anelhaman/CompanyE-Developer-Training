## 9. Docker Swarm

### Introduction to Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool. It allows you to turn a group of Docker engines into a single, unified cluster. Swarm provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and scaling of services across multiple nodes.

### Swarm Cluster Setup
To initialize a Docker Swarm, you can use the `docker swarm init` command on the manager node.

Example:
```bash
docker swarm init
```

This will initialize the Swarm and provide a command to run on worker nodes to join the Swarm. For example, to add a worker node:
```
docker swarm join --token <worker_token> <manager_ip>:<manager_port>
```

### Service Deployment in Swarm
Once your Swarm cluster is set up, you can deploy services across the nodes. Services define how containers should be run in the Swarm.

Example to deploy a service:
```
docker service create --name my-service --replicas 3 nginx
```

This command creates a service named `my-service` with 3 replicas running the Nginx image. The service will be distributed across the nodes in the Swarm.

Example to scale a service:
```
docker service scale my-service=5
```

This will scale the `my-service` to 5 replicas.
