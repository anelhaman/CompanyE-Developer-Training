## 12. Docker Troubleshooting

### Common Docker Issues
Some common Docker issues include:

- **Containers not starting**: This can be caused by issues with the image, configuration, or resource constraints.
- **Port conflicts**: When containers try to bind to the same host port.
- **Resource limits**: Containers may be limited by the hostâ€™s available CPU, memory, or disk space.
- **Networking issues**: Containers may fail to connect due to incorrect network configurations or missing ports.

### Logs and Debugging Containers
Docker provides tools to help diagnose container issues through logs and debugging commands:

- **docker logs**: This command shows the logs from a container, which can help identify issues.
Example:
```bash
docker logs <container_name>
```

- **docker inspect**: This command provides detailed information about a container, including its network settings, volumes, and configuration.
Example:
```bash
docker inspect <container_name>
```

- **docker stats**: This command provides real-time statistics about container resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, and network).
Example:
```bash
docker stats
```

### Docker Commands for Troubleshooting
Docker offers several other commands to help troubleshoot and manage containers:

- **docker ps**: Lists running containers, which helps identify if containers are running as expected.
- **docker exec**: Allows you to run commands inside a container, useful for debugging.
Example:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```

- **docker-compose logs**: If you're using Docker Compose, this command shows the logs for all services defined in a Compose file.
Example:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```
