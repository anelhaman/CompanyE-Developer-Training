## 8. Docker Compose

### Introduction to Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to define the services, networks, and volumes for your application, and then use the `docker-compose` command to manage them.

### Writing Docker Compose Files
A basic `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services in your application, their images, networks, and volumes.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  app:
    image: my-app
    build: ./app
    depends_on:
      - web
```

This example defines two services: `web` (a Nginx container) and `app` (your application container). The `app` service is built from a local directory (`./app`) and depends on the `web` service.

### Multi-container Applications
Docker Compose makes it easy to define and run multi-container applications by defining multiple services in a single file. With Compose, you can manage the lifecycle of these services with a single command, such as `docker-compose up` to start the services or `docker-compose down` to stop and remove them.

Example to start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Example to stop and remove all services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
