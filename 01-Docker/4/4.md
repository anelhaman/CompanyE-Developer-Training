## 4. Working with Docker Containers

### Running Containers
To run a Docker container, use the `docker run` command. This will pull the image (if not already present) and run the container.

Example:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-container nginx
```

This command runs an Nginx container in detached mode (`-d`) with the name `my-container`.

### Stopping and Starting Containers
- To stop a running container:
```
docker stop <container_name_or_id>
```

- To start a stopped container:
```
docker start <container_name_or_id>
```

### Listing Containers
- To list all running containers:
```
docker ps
```

- To list all containers, including stopped ones:
```
docker ps -a
```

### Container Lifecycle
A container goes through several states during its lifecycle:
1. **Created**: The container is created but not yet running.
2. **Running**: The container is actively running.
3. **Paused**: The container is temporarily paused.
4. **Stopped**: The container is stopped but can be restarted.
5. **Exited**: The container has stopped and is no longer active.
6. **Removed**: The container is deleted from the system.

To remove a container:
```
docker rm <container_name_or_id>
```
